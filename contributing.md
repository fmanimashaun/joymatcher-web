# Contributing to Joymatcher

We welcome contributions from our community! Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or improving documentation, your help is valuable. This guide provides instructions on how to contribute to the Joymatcher project.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository:** Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the [Joymatcher repository](https://github.com/fmanimashaun/joymatcher-web) on GitHub. This creates a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone your fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/joymatcher-web.git
   ```

   Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

3. **Create a branch:** Create a new branch for your changes. Use a descriptive name that reflects the purpose of your branch, for example:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name 
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/bug-fix 
   ```

4. **Set up your development environment:** Follow the instructions in the [Project Setup](https://github.com/fmanimashaun/joymatcher-web/wiki/Project-Setup) guide to configure your local development environment.

## Making Changes

* **Follow coding conventions:** Adhere to the Ruby style guide and the established coding conventions in the project. Consistent code makes it easier for everyone to understand and maintain.
* **Write tests:** Write tests for your code to ensure its functionality and prevent regressions. This helps maintain the stability and reliability of the project.
* **Keep commits focused:** Make small, focused commits with clear commit messages. This makes it easier to review changes and understand the evolution of the project.

## Submitting Changes

1. **Push your changes:** Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create a pull request:** Open a pull request from your branch to the `dev` branch of the original Joymatcher repository.

3. **Provide a clear description:** In your pull request description, explain the purpose of your changes, how they were tested, and any relevant information for reviewers. This helps reviewers understand and evaluate your contribution.

4. **Address feedback:** Be responsive to feedback from reviewers and make any necessary changes. Engage in constructive discussion and be willing to iterate on your contribution.
